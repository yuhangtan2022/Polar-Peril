## Introduction

This is a parody game of "Donkey Kong"

## How to play

Your precious penguin was captured by a scary yeti that lives at the top of an ice mountain. You, an expert snow surfer, arrives at the hill's bottom. 
Your objective is to make your way up the hill and rescue your pet penguin. However, the yeti was well prepared and has an infinte stack of giant snowballs at its disposal that will roll down the mountain and tries to obstruct your path. You can take shortcuts by climbing ladders but be wary that the snowballs might do the same and execute an surprise attack. Fortunately, you are equipped with power-ups that can be activated after a set duration, like the 'invincible hammer' that can break the snowball and save you at a crucial moment. You win if you successfully reached your penguin and you lose if all three of your lives are depleted.
